## Conventional Commits

Commits must be written as an imperative sentence, like a order. For example, “Add feature” instead of “Added feature” or “Adding feature".

Follow the commit pattern based on the Angular convention:

> `feat`: implementing a feature

> `fix`: fixing a bug

> `refactor`: refactoring

> `test`: automated tests

> `style`: code formatting

> `perf`: performance tuning

> `docs`: inserting documentation

> `build`: adjusting build settings
